# SwinX

## Introduction
SwinX is a versatile library akin to Wine, designed to facilitate the seamless transition of Windows platform applications onto Linux and macOS environments. Initially developed to support cross-platform functionality for [SOUI5](https://github.com/soui4/soui), SwinX can also be employed by other projects seeking cross-platform compatibility.

## Functionality
By implementing essential Windows client APIs on the Linux and macOS platforms, SwinX enables Windows client code to operate on Linux and macOS as effortlessly as on Windows. Presently, SOUI5 can leverage SwinX to run nearly all its features on Linux and macOS with minimal code alterations.

## Features
This project provides Linux implementations of crucial Windows elements, including HWND functionalities. Notably, only scroll bars are currently supported in the non-client area, with features such as title bars, menus, and MDI window types not yet available.
